    "'''1.What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use\n",
    "MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular open-source document-oriented NoSQL database that uses a flexible JSON-like structure to store data. Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB is a non-relational database, which means it does not use tables or a fixed schema to store data. Instead, MongoDB uses collections of JSON-like documents, which can have different structures and can be modified easily without affecting other documents in the collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are designed to handle large-scale, unstructured, and dynamic data that cannot be easily organized into tables and relationships. These databases use various data models, such as key-value, document, graph, or column-family, to store and query data.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where data is unstructured or semi-structured and requires high scalability and performance. Some of the use cases where MongoDB is a better fit than SQL databases include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Big Data: When dealing with large amounts of unstructured data, MongoDB's document-based structure and dynamic schema allow for faster data ingestion, processing, and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Real-time applications: MongoDB's ability to handle high volumes of read and write operations in real-time makes it suitable for applications that require low-latency data access.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Cloud-based applications: MongoDB's distributed architecture and support for horizontal scaling make it an excellent choice for cloud-based applications that require high availability and fault tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.mobile and IoT applications: MongoDB's flexible data model and support for JSON make it an ideal choice for mobile and IoT applications that require efficient and lightweight data storage and retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, MongoDB is a non-relational database that provides flexibility, scalability, and performance advantages over SQL databases in scenarios where data is unstructured or semi-structured, and high scalability and performance are required.\n",

    "'''Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans--MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that is designed to handle unstructured data and provide a flexible and scalable data storage solution. Some of the key features of MongoDB include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Document-Oriented: MongoDB is a document-oriented database, which means it stores data in a semi-structured format called BSON (Binary JSON). BSON documents are similar to JSON, but with support for additional data types such as Date and Binary data. Each document is self-contained and can have a different structure, which makes it easy to store and retrieve complex data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalable: MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally across multiple servers, making it easy to handle large amounts of data and high traffic loads. It also supports sharding, which allows you to partition data across multiple servers to improve performance and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "High Availability: MongoDB is designed to provide high availability, which means it can automatically handle failures and ensure that data is always available. It does this by replicating data across multiple servers and automatically promoting a new primary server if the current primary fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible Data Model: MongoDB's flexible data model allows you to store data in a variety of ways, including nested documents, arrays, and key-value pairs. This makes it easy to represent complex data structures, such as hierarchical data or social network relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing and Querying: MongoDB provides robust indexing and querying capabilities, which allow you to retrieve data quickly and efficiently. It supports a range of indexing options, including single field, compound, and text indexes, as well as geospatial indexing for location-based queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ad Hoc Queries: MongoDB supports ad hoc queries, which means you can perform complex queries on the fly without having to define a schema or structure in advance. This makes it easy to analyze and explore data without the need for complex SQL queries or predefined data models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, MongoDB is a powerful and flexible NoSQL database that provides a scalable, high-performance, and easy-to-use solution for storing and retrieving complex data structures.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans-In MongoDB, delete operations are used to remove documents from a collection. The three main methods for deleting documents are delete_one(), delete_many(), and drop(). Here's a brief explanation of when and why each method is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "delete_one(): This method is used to delete a single document from a collection that matches a specified filter. If multiple documents match the filter, only the first one found will be deleted. This method is useful when you want to delete a specific document or a small number of documents from a collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "delete_many(): This method is used to delete all documents from a collection that match a specified filter. This method is useful when you want to delete multiple documents from a collection at once. It can also be used to delete all documents in a collection by passing an empty filter object.\n",
    "\n",
    "drop(): This method is used to completely remove a collection from a database. This method is useful when you want to delete an entire collection and all its documents. It is a more drastic method of deleting data than delete_one() or delete_many(), and should be used with caution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, delete_one() is used to remove a single document that matches a filter, delete_many() is used to remove multiple documents that match a filter, and drop() is used to delete an entire collection.\n",
